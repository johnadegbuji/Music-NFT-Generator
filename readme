To use this script follow these steps

1. Pull the code down from github and run NPM install to pull down all dependencies.

2. Next add all the NFTs to the /images folder that you want to use. I recommend going track by track and to even break it up by edition as well. On line 22 of the main.js file change the value of i to the number NFT your beginning from in the /images folder. 

3. Then add the song you would like to be used in the MP4. On line 7 in the main.js file change the inputAudio variable to the new track you've added to the /audio folder

4. Finally run the command "node main.js" to start the generator. All exported MP4s will be output into the /build folder
